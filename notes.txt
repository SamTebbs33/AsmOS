note that FAT12 is little endian, e.g file size 0x18000000 = 24 bytes

root dir sector starts at sector 0x13 and is 14 (0xE) sectors long
each file entry is 32 bytes long
first entry is volume label
	bytes in entry:
	0:7 = file name
	8:10 = extension
	11 = attribute (read only, dir, file, volume etc)
		bits
		0 = read only
		1 = hidden
		2 = system file
		3 = volume label
		4 = dir
		5 = archive (been backed up)
		6,7 = unused
	22:23 = time created
		bits
		15:11 = hour
		10:5 = minutes
		4:0 = seconds
	24:25 = date modified
		bits
		15:9 = year offset from 1980
		8:5 = month
		4:0 = day
	26:27 = first cluster of file
	28:31 = file size
